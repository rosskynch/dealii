/**
 * Class implementing the integrated legendre polynomails described in the PhD thesis of Sabine Zaglmayer.
 *  
 * This class was written based upon the existing deal.II legendre class as a base, but with the coefficents adjusted
 * so that the recursive formula is for the integrated legendre polynomials described in the PhD thesis of
 * Sabine Zaglmayer. The polynomials can be generated recursively from:
 *
 * $L_{0}(x) = -1$  (added so that it can be generated recursively from 0)
 * $L_{1}(x) = x$
 * $L_{2}(x) = \frac{(x^2 - 1)}{2}$
 * $(n+1)L_{n+1} = (2n-1)L_{n} - (n-2)L_{n-1}$.
 *
 * However, it is also possible to generate them directly from the legendre polynomials:
 *
 * $L_{n} = \frac{l_{n} - l_{n-2}}{2n-1)}$
 *
